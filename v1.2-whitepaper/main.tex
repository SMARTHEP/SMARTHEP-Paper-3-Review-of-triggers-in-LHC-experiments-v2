\begin{abstract}
%This white paper from the SMARTHEP Network reviews the current status of trigger systems employed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The principles of triggering in the current state-of-the-art are discussed and illustrated with recent and ongoing developments from the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations. This review places particular emphasis on real-time data processing approaches and techniques.

In modern High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments, trigger strategies play a key role in extracting relevant information from the vast streams of data produced at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Triggers perform the important task of selecting, in real time, the data to be recorded and saved for physics analyses, and must be regularly upgraded and maintained to suit experimental needs with collisions at increasing energies and luminosities. This white paper from the SMARTHEP Network presents a high-level overview and reviews recent developments of triggering practices employed at the LHC. Particular emphasis is placed on real-time data processing approaches and techniques. The general trigger principles applied at a modern HEP experiment are highlighted, with specific reference to the current trigger state-of-the-art within the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations. Furthermore, a brief synopsis of the new trigger paradigm required by the upcoming high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC is provided. 

\textit{As of 31/01/2024, this draft has not yet undergone review from experts from the LHC collaborations. Note also that this white paper is not meant to provide an exhaustive review or substitute documentation and papers from the collaborations themselves, but rather offer general considerations and examples from the literature that are relevant to the SMARTHEP  network.} 

%the application of machine learning techniques for real-time analysis (RTA) of collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It discusses the crucial role of RTA in addressing the data-processing challenges faced by LHC experiments and how modern ML techniques are helping to overcome them. First, we provide some insights into selecting the most suitable ML algorithms and adapting them to the real- time environment using software techniques and hardware accelerators. Then, we review a small selection of current and future uses of machine learning for RTA that are of particular interest to the SMARTHEP network. We continue by emphasizing the importance of collaborations between the high-energy physics community and industry in tackling these challenges and we showcase the mutual benefits that can be achieved. 
%The white paper is not meant to provide an exhaustive review, but rather some general considerations and a limited number of relevant examples from the literature that are relevant to the SMARTHEP innovative training network

%This document is a draft of the trigger whitepaper written by the ESRs that is going to be circulated within the SMARTHEP network. Parts of it may be made public at a later stage. It is intended to serve as an exercise for the SMARTHEP ESRs to learn more about the trigger systems of different experiments (since many ESRs chose to write about the trigger systems of experiments that they are not members of).

%\section{Introduction}
%Its always good to have an introduction, if only to have an example for a section. And here is an example for a reference from the bibtex file (see \cite{einstein}). Its also pretty easy to reference figures (see Figure \ref{fig:examplecernlogo}). \\

%You also have the option of using colored text, for example \color{blue} this part in blue,  \color{red} this part in red  \color{green} and this part in green, before \color{black} going back to black.

%\item Everyone loves an enumerated list.
%\item If you prefer bulleted lists, see below.
%\end{enumerate}

%Of course there are always use cases for list with enumerations, and lists with bullets only, which is why it is useful to have examples of both.

%\section{The first section after the introduction}
%Since an example of a ToC is not much fun with only one section, lets make another one and throw in some subsections as well.


%\subsection{The first sub-section}
%How about structuring the document into more subsections.

%\subsection{The second sub-section}
%Tables are just as easy as figures to construct and reference, for example this one here (see Table \ref{tab:exampletable}).
