\section{Reconstruction of event objects}

The reconstruction of events from detector information is a key function of any trigger system; trigger selections typically involve imposing conditions on reconstructed objects including particle tracks and calorimeter clusters. 
The complexity of these reconstruction methods can range from lower-level algorithms (such as track finding and cell clustering) to the full, offline-quality reconstruction of entire events and is determined by the requirements of the given trigger stage. In this chapter, trigger architectures and their comprising algorithms are discussed.
