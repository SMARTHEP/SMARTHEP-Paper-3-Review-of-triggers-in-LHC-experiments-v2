\section{Reconstruction of event objects}

The reconstruction of events from detector information is a key function of any trigger system; trigger selections typically involve imposing conditions on reconstructed objects including particle tracks and calorimeter clusters. 

In the following, we will focus on examples of reconstruction tasks that are performed \textit{online} within the trigger system of different experiments. 
We denote with \textit{offline} reconstruction tasks those that are performed on objects in events selected by the trigger system at a later stage.  

The complexity and performance requirements of online reconstruction methods can range from fast, lower-level algorithms to full, offline-quality reconstruction of entire events and is determined by the requirements of the given trigger stage. 
It is important for online algorithms to be aligned with (ideally identical to) offline algorithms in terms of inputs, implementation and performance, so that there is a good match between physics objects that inform the event selection and physics objects used for analysis. 
This is also crucial for real-time physics analysis, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:RTA_physics}.
