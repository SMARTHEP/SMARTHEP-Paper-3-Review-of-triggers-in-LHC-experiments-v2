journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The ALICE experiment at the LHC was designed and built to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma, a state of matter where quarks and gluons are not confined to hadrons and that can be recreated using high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The plans for ALICE after 2020 include the collection of more than 10 nb−1 of heavy-ion collisions at luminosities up to 6×1027 cm−2 s−1, corresponding to collision rates of 500 kHz. Such scenario imposes stringent constraints to the detector performances, forcing a major upgrade of the experiment. In this proceeding the main characteristics of the detector upgrades are presented, in particular the contributions from mexican groups are highlighted.}
