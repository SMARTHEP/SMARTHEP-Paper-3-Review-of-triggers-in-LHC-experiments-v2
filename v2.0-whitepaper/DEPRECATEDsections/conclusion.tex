\section{Conclusions}
The trigger systems employed by major LHC experiments in Run 3 leverage key advancements in computing technologies and approaches to overcome data challenges. Additionally, the successful implementation of such systems builds upon the wealth of experience gained through operation and exploratory studies in Run 1 and Run 2. %The upgrades performed and planned by said experiments also pave the way for tthese systems  HL LHC.
